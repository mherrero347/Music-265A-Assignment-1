# Music 265A - Assignment 1 - Additive Synthesizer

This is the MainComponent.cpp file for a simple additive synthesizer application in Juce. It is
a modification of the simple sine wave oscillator (https://goo.gl/lrVt2K) written by Romain Michon.
It creates an array of five sine wave oscillators (although this count can be changed by editing the
SINE_WAVE_COUNT global variable in MainComponent.cpp), each an octave apart. Then, the user can use the
toggle buttons at the bottom of the UI to select which of the 5 octave partials to play. The user can
control the overall gain of the sound being produced as well as the frequency of the lowest partial
using the sliders.

A short video of the application in action can be found here:

Have fun!
